<analysis>
I have chronologically analyzed the entire conversation trajectory between the user and the previous AI engineer. The initial request was a broad goal: to review and improve the professionalism of the  website. The engineer began by exploring the existing codebase, which was a full-stack application, but quickly pivoted upon receiving the user's GitHub token and repository. The work then focused exclusively on a separate Vite-based React project located in .

The development process was highly iterative, driven by specific, incremental requests from the user. Key features implemented include: a floating WhatsApp contact button, a dealer locator page using Leaflet.js with data from a manageable  file, and a -based contact form.

A significant portion of the work involved UI/UX refinement. This included:
-   A complete, multi-stage redesign of the homepage () to be more modern and professional.
-   Resolving numerous layout issues, such as excessive whitespace on tablet and desktop screens, by transitioning from fixed padding to responsive viewport units.
-   Refactoring a broken language selector to use SVG icons instead of problematic emoji characters.
-   Moving a CRM button from the header to a more subtle position in the footer.
-   Updating product images based on user uploads.
-   Refactoring multiple pages (, , , ) to use new, reusable  and  components for a consistent layout and navigation.

The engineer consistently used Git to commit and push changes to the user's repository, handling merge conflicts when they arose. The final interaction before this summary request was to fix an incorrect, non-SEO-friendly product URL and update the product's description with detailed text provided by the user.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to enhance the  website to appear more professional, trustworthy, and modern, converting it from its current state to a polished, clinic-quality product showcase site. The site does not handle online sales but focuses on product information and brand trust.

**Implemented Features & Fixes:**
1.  **WhatsApp Integration:** A floating WhatsApp button was added to all pages for quick user contact.
2.  **Dealer Locator Map:** A new Bayiler (Dealers) page was created, featuring an interactive map (Leaflet.js) that plots dealer locations from an easily editable  file.
3.  **Homepage Redesign:** The entire homepage was revamped for a modern, professional look, including the hero section, product displays, and trust-building elements.
4.  **UI/UX Consistency:** Reusable  and  components were created and applied across all pages (, , , ) to ensure a consistent navigation experience and layout. A Back button was implicitly added via the consistent header.
5.  **Layout & Responsiveness:** Addressed significant whitespace issues on large screens and tablets by implementing responsive padding and layout adjustments.
6.  **Component Fixes:** The language selector was fixed to properly display flags on desktop, and the main contact form was converted to a  link to resolve email sending issues.
7.  **Clickable Elements:** Product images and cards on the homepage were made clickable, directing users to the respective product detail pages.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** React with Vite.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and custom CSS in .
- **Routing:**  for client-side routing.
- **Mapping:**  and  for the interactive dealer map.
- **Version Control:** Git, with direct commits and pushes to the user's GitHub repository.
- **Data Management:** Static JSON () for user-editable content (dealer locations).
- **Contact Form:** Use of the  protocol as a simple, client-side solution for form submission.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a standalone React frontend application built with Vite. The AI engineer cloned the user's repository into  and performed all work within that directory.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the main landing page and the most frequently modified file. It contains the hero section, product showcases, trust badges, and contact form.
    -   **Changes:** The file underwent a near-complete rewrite to modernize the design. Numerous fine-tuning edits were made to adjust spacing, update images, change component layouts (e.g., language selector, CRM button), convert the contact form инфекцииto a  link, and make product images clickable.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the application's routes using , mapping URL paths to their corresponding components.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to add the new route for the  (Dealers) page, pointing to the  component. Product routes like  are also defined here.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These are new, reusable components created to ensure a consistent look, feel, and navigation structure across the website.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch by extracting the header and footer logic from . They contain navigation links, the language selector, and social media links.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** These files implement the dealer locator feature.  renders the Leaflet map, while  provides a simple, user-editable data source for dealer locations.
    -   **Changes:** Both files were created from scratch.  was later updated to include the new shared  and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Displays the details for a single product. It was identified as having a poor layout.
    -   **Changes:** The component was significantly refactored to have a professional, responsive two-column layout (image on the left, text on the right) and to incorporate the shared  and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains global styles and custom CSS, including the pulse animation for the WhatsApp button and root styles for Tailwind.
    -   **Changes:** Custom CSS for the WhatsApp button animation was added. A  class was modified to control the max-width of the main content area, addressing the excessive whitespace issue on large monitors.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no major features pending from the initial requests, as they have been iteratively implemented. The last remaining task is the one currently being worked on.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task is to address a multi-part request from the user concerning a specific product page ().
The work involves two main actions:

1.  **Fixing the URL:** The current product URL is , which is incorrect and not SEO-friendly. The user has requested it be changed to something more appropriate, like  (cracked-heel-cream). This requires identifying the product's ID in the codebase (, ) and updating the slug used for routing and navigation.

2.  **Updating the Product Description:** The user has provided a large, detailed, and professionally written block of text for the Intense Repair Cream. This new text needs to be placed into the  component, replacing the existing, insufficient description. The layout must be adjusted to accommodate the new, structured content (e.g., headings, lists, bold text) in a professional manner.

The previous engineer had just started on this by attempting to locate the product ID in  to begin the URL slug change.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will find the product data, likely in , update the product's uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) to , and then replace the description content within  with the new text provided by the user.
